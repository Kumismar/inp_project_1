# inp_project1
Brainfuck VHDL interpret (I think I don't want to call it a processor/CPU) as project in INP course at FIT BUT.

## Every code I publish on GitHub is with a good intention to help others study.
Review the code, download it, play with it and inspect it anyway you'll like to. 
Never copy a code you don't understand and most importantly, don't copy submit the code anywhere as your own work, it's not worth it.
I hope my code will be helpful to anyone with clean intentions.

### Disclaimer: The code often isn't perfect and there might be mistakes. Keep that in mind.
